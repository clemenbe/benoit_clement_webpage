Professor at ENSTA Bretagne (France) and Professor at Flinders University (Australia)
====
My main interests are in Robotics and Automatic Control. The underwater activities naturally lead to marine robotics (surface and underwater)
I am currently in Adelaide Keywords : AUV, Robust and Adaptive Control, Robotics, Embedded Systems, Optimization, Reinforcement Learning
Research teams :
1. MATRIX of the LabSTICC UMR 6285 - CNRS ([web](http://www.labsticc.fr/)),
1. College of Science and Engineering, Flinders University
1. CROSSING IRL CNRS 2010 between CNRS, Naval Group, Flinders University, University of Adelaide, University of South Australia ([web](https://crossing.cnrs.fr/)).

Head of Information & Technologies Departement at ENSTA Bretagne
====
People : 50 (professors, associate professors, engineers) and 60 (PhD and post-doc) The is a teaching and research center on communication systems studied from the hardware point of view as well as from the software point of view. The integration of these two aspects has opened a new path for research. The strength and success of the Departement is based on the high level of collaborations between experts of different domains and the development of original research axes. All activities essentially focus on Ocean and Information Technology, Cyber security, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Neural Machines and Information Theory.

Short Bio
======
Benoit Clement is a Professor at ENSTA Bretagne (Brest, France) and also at Flinders University (Adelaide, Australia). He has been Head of the Information Science and Engineering Departement at ENSTA Bretagne since 2022. He used to served as deputy Head of the Lab-STICC (CNRS UMR 6285) from 2016 to 2021, and as the head of the Ocean Sensing and Mapping Department at ENSTA Bretagne (2014-2017). He is currently in Adelaide, South Australia, as CNRS Researcher at CROSSING IRL CNRS 2010 between CNRS, Naval Group, Flinders University, University of Adelaide, University of South Australia (web) He has served as a member of IFAC technical committees on Robust Control and also on Marine Systems since 2020.

He has been invited Professor at:
* Ocean University of China (Qingdao): 6 weeks between 2014-2016;
* Universidad Nacional de La Plata (Argentina) in 2018 (link);
* invited Professor at Flinders University (Adelaide, SA) with AID and Region Bretagne funding : 8 months in 2020.

He received a Master of Science in Automatic Control and Signal Processing (DEA ATSI) from University Paris XI in 1998 and a Master of Engineering in Automatic Control and Systems from Supelec in 1998. From October 1998 to September 2001, he was a PhD Students at Supelec (now CentraleSupelec). He received the PhD degree in Physics 'Multiobjective synthesis and gain scheduling: application to an aerospace launcher guidance’ from thr University Paris XI in September 2001 (pdf) and the “Habilitation a Diriger des Recherches” (French Habilitation - HDR) degree in Automatic Control from the Universite de Bretagne Occidentale in 2015.

Former positions:
* Supelec, associate professor
* French Space Agency (CNES), Launcher Directorate, in charge of GNC activities and also project manager.
* Project Manager at Pole Mer Bretagne Atlantique (Sea Innovation & Business Cluster). Pole Mer Bretagne Atlantique is the heart of a network in which major companies, SMEs, research centres and higher education establishments combine ideas and skills to develop collaborative innovative projects within the maritime industry.

His current research focus are on:
* Global Optimization used for strutured robust control applied to robotics.
* Machine Learning for Adaptive Control
* Collision avoidance for marine robots
